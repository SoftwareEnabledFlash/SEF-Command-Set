# Scope

This project is dedicated to the definition of the Command Set to be used for the Software-Enabled Flash Project API and SDKs to communicate with Software-Enabled Flash compliant hardware.  Only the command set will be covered, with actual implementation in the hardware, firmware, and flash outside the scope of the project.

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
